  Potentially ASked Questions

  1. What is this thing?

      This is a soundboard application created using Python, PyAudio, and wxPython. 

  2. What does it do?
        
      The Ryouba Soundboard allows you to load sound files which can be played by 
      clicking on the button that is created. You can save the soundboard for 
      later use. The saved file is a simple list of files that will be loaded. 
      
  3. What are its major limitaitons?

      a. Soundboards can not be easily shared because .rsb files are simple lists 
         of files that must exist on your system. Maybe this will change someday. 

      b. No sound files are included even though you might expect there to be some
         famous quotes from the lips of the famous Ryouba. 

  4. Who the hell is Ryouba?
    
      A friend of mine that used to say some of the funniest stuff I've ever heard
      in my life. One night while our Minecraft server was down we played Minecraft
      D&D style. I recorded the entire session and saved over 100 clips of Ryouba
      so that I could fool people on Mumble into thinking he was in channel. 


  5. How do I get started with using this stupid thing?

      All operating systems - Install Python, PyAudio and wxPython. Run the command...
      
        python2 rsb.py

      Linux - If you're using a Linux system try running the "rsb" file buried deep
      within the build directory.

  6. I want RSB to do _______. Why doesn't it do ________?

      The Ryouba Soundboard was not designed to do __________. If you would like it 
      to ________ then send me a message requesting the feature. You could also 
      fork this project, code the feature yourself and then send me a merge request.
      I am likely to merge any improvements made.

  7. What sort of files can it play?

      It plays .wavs just fine. I haven't tried anything else yet and don't plan to.
